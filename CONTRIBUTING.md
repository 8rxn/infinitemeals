# Contributing to the InfiniteMeals Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the InfiniteMeals Project! We appreciate your efforts to make this project better and welcome contributions from the community.

## How to Contribute

We value all forms of contributions, including bug reports, feature requests, code changes, documentation improvements, and community support. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the Next.js repository to your GitHub account by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

2. **Set up the Development Environment:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies by following the instructions in the project's README.md file.

3. **Create a New Branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. Name the branch in a descriptive manner that reflects the nature of your contribution (e.g., `fix-issue-123`, `add-new-feature`, `update-documentation`).

4. **Work on Your Contribution:** Make your desired changes or additions to the codebase, documentation, or other project elements. Ensure your code follows the project's coding guidelines and best practices.

5. **Commit Your Changes:** Once your work is complete, commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. Refer to the [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) below for more information.

6. **Pull Request:** Push your branch to your forked repository and create a pull request against the `main` branch of the original Next.js repository. Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes in the pull request.

7. **Review and Iterate:** The project maintainers will review your pull request, provide feedback, and work with you to refine your contribution if needed. Be prepared to make changes based on their feedback.

8. **Celebrate!**: Once your pull request is accepted and merged into the main repository, your contribution becomes a part of the Next.js project. Congratulations, and thank you for your valuable contribution!

## Commit Message Guidelines

Writing clear and descriptive commit messages is essential for maintaining a clean and understandable project history. Follow these guidelines for writing commit messages:

- Use the present tense and a concise description of the changes made (e.g., "Fix typo in README.md" or "Add new feature: User authentication").
- Include any relevant issue or pull request numbers in the commit message (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456").
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line, and use the body to provide more detailed information if necessary.

## Code Style and Guidelines

The InfiniteMeals project follows specific coding guidelines and standards. Before submitting your contribution, ensure that your code adheres to these guidelines. For more details, refer to the [code style guide](CODE_STYLE.md) in the repository.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a friendly and welcoming community for everyone.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the maintainers or the community via GitHub issues, the project's Discord channel, or any other communication channels specified in the repository.

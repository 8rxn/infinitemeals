## Infinite Meals
This is a Next JS Project that can fetch any recipes known to the training of Text Davinci 3. The project is in the process of being optimized. Multiple features are in their early stages which will be tweaked or replaced with better alternatives. I hope you Have a good experience using the service.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

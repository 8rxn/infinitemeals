## Infinite Meals

Infinite Meals is a recipe search engine that uses OpenAI's Text Davinci 003 Model through Open AI API to generate recipes for any given Food. It's a simple and easy way to find new recipes and get inspiration for your next meal.

## How to Search For Recipes:

You can Visit [https://infinitemeals.vercel.app](https://infinitemeals.vercel.app)

You can find Recipes in multiple ways:

- You can search for any recipe by going on your dashboard and searching for a recipe.

## How does it Work?

Multiple Things Happen before the searched Recipe is returned to you.

1. The recipe is Searched for in the Redis Cache against [when recipe is searched for the first time, it is cached]
2. If unavailable in cache, it's looked for in the database.
3. If the recipe is still unavailable, Text - Davinci - 003 is used to get the recipe for that item.
4. The response from Text - Davinci - 003 is displayed to the user at this point of time.
5. The response from the Database is then added into the Database and Cached for future use.
6. Meanwhile, When Text - Davinci - 003 is used for fetching the recipe, the image is being looked for using Google Images Search from SERP API. The image fetched from the API is added to Cloudinary.
7. The image added is displayed while the Image URL is added into the recipe Database and cache for future use.
